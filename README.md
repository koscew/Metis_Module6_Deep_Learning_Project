# Metis\_Module6\_Deep\_Learning\_Project

This is the sixth project of Metis Data Science Bootcamp. We are gong to use image data to build a neural network model that addresses a useful prediction. I will use images with and without human to build a neural network model to recognize whether an image contains human.
